This fixed my npm issues with raspbian
I'm probably gonna run this with forever, It's globally installed with npm install forever -g 
I mean... I _could_ use & to run a background process of it, but _we're modern_
it also now opens a stream and listens for mentions, and makes some cheesy rhymed reply
I'm gonna work on putting "suggestion getting and subsequent random-rhyme getting" into
a seperate function. I didn't really anticipate this to be written more than once lol
alright, did the "mild refactoring", feels better lol
